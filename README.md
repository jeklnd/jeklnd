- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jesse Krensel.
- ðŸš€ To solve technical problems I usually reach for JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, Nextjs, and Material UI, but I'm familiar with many technologies and learn quickly on the job. I'm particularly good at building static sites from design mockups.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: send me an email at jdkrensel@gmail.com or message me on LinkedIn at  www.linkedin.com/in/jessekrensel
