# I can build your frontend and solve technical problems.

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jeklnd.
- ðŸš€ To solve technical problems I favor JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, Nextjs, and Material UI, but I'm familiar with many and learn quickly on the job. I'm particularly good at building static sites from design mockups.
